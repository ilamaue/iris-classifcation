‚¨ÜÔ∏è iris classfication project 
```

This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on the physical measurements of the flowers. The classification is done using machine learning techniques, and the dataset used is the famous Iris Dataset, which includes features such as the length and width of sepals and petals.
